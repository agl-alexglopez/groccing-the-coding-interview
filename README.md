# GroCCCing the Coding Interview

This repository contains coding interview practice problems in C, specifically to test my [C Container Collection (CCC)](https://github.com/agl-alexglopez/ccc).

## Rationale

Has the following ever happened to you?

You sit down at a fine dining establishment, review the menu, and notice that the special for the night is a superb steak and lobster dish, market price. After ordering said dish, you receive your meal but immediately notice some problems. You call over the waiter to solemnly inform him that the bread for the table is too warm, the steak is exceedingly juicy, and the lobster is perfectly buttery. Your folks back home always warned you of the dangers that may come from too much of a good thing. Responsibly, you send the food back hoping the kitchen will remedy these egregious errors and provide the appropriate dining experience.

If the above scenario resonates with you, then you have stumbled upon the right place in your coding interview preparation journey. Why prepare for coding interviews in languages like Python, Java, or C++? Who needs helpful standard libraries or robust web browser interfaces? Success has two C's for a reason. A C compiler is all you need.

## About

This project serves as a testbed for my C Container Collection. By solving interview-style problems in C, I simultaneously verify container correctness, build real usage examples, and avoid the soul crushing boredom that comes with logging on to LeetCode.

Check back for updates as the repository matures. Right now it’s a personal development helper, but proper build instructions and usage examples will arrive as things stabilize.
