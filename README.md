# groCCing-the-coding-interview

Has the following ever happened to you? You sit down at a fine dining establishment, review the menu, and notice that the special for the night is a superb steak and lobster dish, market price. After ordering, you receive your meal but immediately notice some problems. You call over the waiter to solemnly inform him that the bread for the table is too warm, your steak is exceedingly juicy, and your lobster is excessively buttery. Your folks always taught you that too much of a good thing can do more harm than good. Responsibly, you send the food back hoping the kitchen will remedy these egregious errors and give you the dining experience you expect. 

If the above scenario resonates with you, then you have stumbled upon the right place in your coding interview preparation journey. Why prepare for coding interviews in languages like Python, Java, or C++ with egregiously helpful standard libraries? Just do it in C. Success has two C's for a reason. 

Let us compile our solutions, as K&R intended.

## About

This is a test bed for my [C Container Collection](https://github.com/agl-alexglopez/ccc). I can prep for coding interviews and exercise the test cases for various containers at the same time with this approach. Check back for updates on how to build and use this repository as it matures. Right now, it is just a personal helper to obviate the crushing boredom that comes when logging on to Leetcode.
